# Corpus of opinions in Portuguese about electronic products for contrastive summarization

This repository contains a corpus that was built to test methods of contrastive opinion summarization, which is a task that aims to compare two entities from  opinionated texts written about them. There was manual annotation of information about the opinions contained in each sentence, each opinion being indicated by its aspect and polarity: the aspect is the characteristic of the product that the opinion evaluates and the polarity indicates whether the opinion is positive or negative. The 642 sentences of the corpus were collected from 542 opinionated reviews published by buyers on Buscap√© website and refer to four different products: two mobile phones and two digital cameras. The corpus was extended through the creation of fictitious entities that contain sentences of the selected real entities with different strategies to simulate other possibilities of sets of opinionated texts. Two pairs of real entities and six fictitious pairs were formed.
